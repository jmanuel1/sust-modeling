* proving properties of distributions
** support of (binomial n p) is [0..n]

* having multiple interpretations of a monad
** probability
- calculate distribution exhaustively
- calculate distribution by sampling (Monte Carlo method)
- take a sample of a distribution

* proving properties of a model
** total population of all species constant in a very simple population model

* tracking the 'error bars' in a calculation and being able to specify constraints on them

* correct use of units

* automatic differentiation

* tracking data provenance at the type level

---

* maybe focus on exploratory models
