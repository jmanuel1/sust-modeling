* proving properties of distributions
** support of (binomial n p) is [0..n]

* having multiple interpretations of a monad
** probability
- calculate distribution exhaustively
- calculate distribution by sampling (Monte Carlo method)
- take a sample of a distribution
** implementations
- defining a monadic 'instruction set' and writing various interpreters
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3JAuGlOgM][free monads]]

* proving properties of a model
** total population of all species constant in a very simple population model

* tracking the 'error bars' in a calculation and being able to specify constraints on them

* correct use of units
** in spreadsheets
