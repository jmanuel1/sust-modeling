#+TITLE: Adaptive capacity model

The code was built using version ~0.5.1-f93e1c4ea~ (that is, commit ~f93e1c4ea~)
of the [[https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2][Idris 2]] compiler. It might work
on the official 0.5.1 version and the latest version from the ~main~ branch, but
that has not been tested.

To load the adaptive capacity model into the REPL, first clone this repositiory,
then run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$PATH_TO_IDRIS_2 AdaptiveCapacity.idr --find-ipkg
#+END_SRC

in the directory you cloned the repository into. (~$PATH_TO_IDRIS_2~ is whatever
path the compiler can be found at on your system.)

To load the example model instance based on
[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800400010X?casa_token=lAgRsi4FpwkAAAAA:t8yHOFod2fm_dtOKzmnADdfMMR3UkZNNmAU7J749J8JiOTb2OfPK8FjSAcMYdeP0zseqk5ltnPw#BIB25][O'Brien et al. (2004)]] into the REPL, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$PATH_TO_IDRIS_2 OBrienEtAl.idr --find-ipkg
#+END_SRC

I suggest installing [[https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap][rlwrap]] and
prefixing the above commands with that so that the REPL experience is bearable.
